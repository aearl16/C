In the abc program in Section 1.8, "Arrays, Strings, and Pointers," on page 43, we
used the loop:

for(; *p != '\0'; ++p)
{
    if(*p == 'e')
        *p = 'E';
    if(*p == ' ')
        *p = '\n';
}

Braces areneeded because the body of the for loop consists of two if statements.
Change the code to:

for(; *p != '\0'; ++p)
    if(*p == 'e')
        *p = 'E';
    else if(*p == ' ')
        *p = '\n';

Explain why braces are not needed now. Check to see that the run time behaivior of the program
is the same as before. Explain why this is so.

Answer: If else statements are considered one block and not a compound statement. Hence no
braces are needed. Operation is the same as having two ifs, although some compilers require
the else if be terminated with a final else statement as failsafe.
